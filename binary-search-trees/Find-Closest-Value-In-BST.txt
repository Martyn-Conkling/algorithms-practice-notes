Find Closest Value in BST

Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree, 
and a target integer value and returns the closest value to that target value contained in the BST.
You can assume that there will only be one closes value.
Each BST node has an integer, value, a left child node, and a right child.
A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left;
its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None/null



function findClosestValueInBst(tree, target) {
  
	//This is a recursive Solution
	return helperFunction(tree, target, tree.value)
	
}

function helperFunction (tree, target, closest){
	if (tree === null){return closest};
	if (Math.abs(target - closest) > Math.abs(target - tree.value)){
		closest = tree.value;
	}
	if(target < tree.value){
		return helperFunction(tree.left, target, closest);
	} else if (target > tree.value){
		return helperFunction(tree.right, target, closest);
	} else {
		return tree.value
		// could also be return closest
	}
}



// This is the class of the input tree. Do not edit.
class BST {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

// Do not edit the line below.
exports.findClosestValueInBst = findClosestValueInBst;
